          <h2>Welcome to The Space Drone Project</h2>

<p>This is a competition between two friends to see who can</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Send a drone to the highest altitude</li>
<li>Take the best photo in the process </li>
<li>Land it as close as possible to their landing spot</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="http://moeadham.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Project-Summary.png" alt="Space Drone Project Summary"></p>

<h2>Why</h2>

<p>Daniel and I are both geeks, who recently finished Graduate school in Nanotechnology. We also like crazy projects. I decided that taking a picutre from the edge of space would be cool, but it is a lot of work to get the picutres back. Inspired by a project we saw about sending a remote plane to the edge of space, Daniel and I decided we could do better.</p>

<p>We will send a drone to the edge of space, have it take photos, and then gracefully (hopefully), glide back to safety and deliver us the goods.</p>

<h2>The Competition.</h2>

<h3>Judging</h3>

<p>The competition is simple. I (Moe) live in Canada, Daniel lives in Switzerland. Therefore we both have to do this on our own. I think I am better at this than Daniel, so we are making it a bit of a competition. The goal is to see who can win on the most of three judging criteria:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Highest Altitude (measured by GPS)</li>
<li>Landing distance from our home (or desired mission control point)</li>
<li>Best Photo (voted by an impartial group)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>Prize</h3>

<p>If Moe wins, Daniel has to go on a hike for two days without a shower. Daniel's prize remains to be determined.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<h3>Altitude</h3>

<p>We will be getting to altitude using a basic weather balloon. Helium, or hydrogen.</p>

<h3>Drone</h3>

<p>The drone will be ARDUINO based, using the Arduplane project as a basis.<a href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ardupilot-mega-home-page">http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ardupilot-mega-home-page</a>.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>All communication will be done through a Cheap-as-hell ANDROID phone. Therefore, once the drone reaches a high enough altitude, it will be in radio silence. While there is a communication link, the mission control will be able to wire directly into the ANDROID camera for live video, and GPS information.</p>

<h3>Control</h3>

<p>The GPS, gyroscope and communication will be conrolled by the ANDROID phone, while the drone motor GPIO and balloon detachment will be controlled by the ARDUINO. The two will be connected using the AMARINO toolkit.</p>

<h3>Photos</h3>

<p>The actual photo devices will be decided by each team.</p>

<h2>Who?</h2>

<p>Moe Adham (<a href="https://github.com/moeadham" class="user-mention">@moeadham</a>) and Daniel Ferrari</p>

<h2>When</h2>

<p>Launches are planned for Summer 2013.</p>

<h2>Support or Contact</h2>
